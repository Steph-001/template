# Wh- Questions 
## What are Wh- Questions?
Wh- questions are **information questions** that start with question words like **WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY, HOW**.

## üîß The Auxiliary "DO" in Wh- Questions

**Remember:** Just like yes/no questions, Wh- questions also use the auxiliary **DO ‚Üí DID** in the past!

### Present vs Past Wh- Questions:
- **Present:** "Where do you live?" ‚Üí **Past:** "Where did you live?"
- **Present:** "What does he want?" ‚Üí **Past:** "What did he want?"

## üìù Structure of Wh- Questions in the Past

**Formula:** **Wh- word + DID + subject + base verb + ?**

### Examples from Lincoln's life:

**WHEN** questions:
- **When did** Lincoln **become** President? *(He became President in 1860)*

**WHERE** questions:
- **Where did** Lincoln **grow up**? *(He grew up in Kentucky)*

**WHAT** questions:
- **What did** Lincoln **sign** in 1863? *(He signed the Emancipation Proclamation)*

**WHO** questions:
- **Who did** Lincoln **marry**? *(This asks about the object)*
- **Who** **died** in 1835? *(When WHO is the subject, no DID needed!)*

**WHY** questions:
- **Why did** people **remember** Lincoln? *(Because he was a great leader)*

**HOW** questions:
- **How did** Lincoln **die**? *(He was assassinated)*

---

## ‚ö° Special Case: WHO as Subject

When **WHO** is the **subject** of the question, we DON'T use DID:

**Examples:**
- **Who died** in 1835? *(Ann Rutledge)*
- **Who became** President? *(Lincoln)*
- **Who made** a film about Lincoln? *(Spielberg)*

**Why?** Because WHO replaces the subject, so we don't need the auxiliary!

---

## üéØ Key Points to Remember

1. **Structure:** Wh- word + DID + subject + base verb + ?
2. **Exception:** When WHO is the subject ‚Üí no DID needed
3. **Main verb:** Always use base form after DID
4. **Same rule:** DID does the "past work", main verb stays simple
