# Modal Auxiliaries

## Expressing Attitude

Let's look at some sentences from our motivation scale:
- I **won't** do it
- I **can't** do it  
- I **can** do it
- I **will** do it

## üîß What are Modal Auxiliaries?

**Modal auxiliaries** are helper words that show your **attitude** toward the action.

**Our modals:** can, can't, will, won't

**They show:**
- **Ability:** I **can** do it
- **Willingness:** I **will** help you

## üìù Structure of Modal Auxiliaries

**Formula:** Subject + MODAL + main verb (base form)

**Important:** No TO after modals!

### AFFIRMATIVE
- I **can** speak English
- He **can** become President  
- She **will** succeed
- They **will** try again

###  NEGATIVE  
- I **can't** do it *(can + not = can't)*
- He **won't** give up *(will + not = won't)*

###  INTERROGATIVE
- **Can** you help me?
- **Will** the skater kid get there?

## üéØ Key Points to Remember

1. **Structure:** Modal + base verb (no TO!)
2. **Negative:** Modal + not (often contracted: can't, won't, shouldn't)
3. **Questions:** Modal comes first (Can you...? Will he...?)
4. **Attitude:** Modals show how you feel about the action

## üí™ "No Pain, No Gain" with Modals

**From negative to positive attitude:**

2. **I can't do it** *(inability)*  
3. **I can do it** *(ability)*
4. **I will do it** *(determination)*

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Warning!**

**WANT** and **TRY** are **NOT** modal auxiliaries!

-  I want **TO** do it

-  I try **TO** do it

**Also remember:** Modals never add -s for third person!
- ‚úÖ He **can** do it 
- ‚úÖ She **will** succeed 

**Remember:** Modals work without TO and without -s!
