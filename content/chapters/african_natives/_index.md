    <p class="card-text text-justify">During the 1740s and 1750s, many African slaves escaped from the slave hunters. They fled to the bayous of Louisiana where they met Native Americans who hid them or took them in. Both minorities helped each other. Nowadays to celebrate this friendship, around forty "tribes" parade every year in March in New Orleans during <span class="text-primary fw-bold"> Mardi Gras </span>. Each "tribe" creates new costumes with bright feathers and colourful beads. The marchers are mostly African-Americans including African-Native Americans.</p>
